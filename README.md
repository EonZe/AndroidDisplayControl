#AndroidDisplayContro

Author: Leopold Hauptman aka EonZombie

Allows you to controll 2 x 4 led display.

How it works:
1. Click on Bluetooth button to get to device selector menu.
Already paired devices will be displayed. Click on scan button to find
new devices (but I recommand pairing them by using builtin bluetooth
menu)

2.Upon selecting a device, it's Bluetooth MAC address gets stored for
further use and you get redirected back to main menu.

3. Fill the text boxes with character (or let them be filled
automatically), when you type a character, current one gets replaced with
new one.

4. Click "SEND" button to send data to remote bluetooth device.
First, app will try to connect to the remote device and send first row,
than it wil disconnect and recconnect, sending another row. This prevents
rows from being read as one row.

This app was custom built for Arduino project, developed in Secondary
school for technical professions Šiška, Ljublana, Slovenia.

You may modify, customaze or use parts of this for your own needs.
